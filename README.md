# PRODIGY_CS_01
This is the first task I was given during the internship at Prodigy InfoTech. It is a program in python which uses a very simple encryption algorithm. User has to specify a shift value for encryption or decryption. This python program encrypts or decrypts a user's message using Caesar Cipher Algorithm.
